# Graphing Tool

## 1. What is a Graphing Tool?

The **Graphing Tool** is a simple yet powerful web application designed to visualize quadratic equations in a responsive and interactive environment. This tool allows users to input parameters for a quadratic equation and see the graph of the function dynamically. It is built with JavaScript and HTML5's Canvas API, making it lightweight, efficient, and easily accessible through any modern web browser.

### Objective

The primary goal of this project is to provide a user-friendly interface for students, educators, or anyone interested in mathematics to visualize quadratic functions. By offering real-time graphing capabilities, the tool aims to enhance understanding of mathematical concepts through interactive visualization.

## 2. How Does This Graphing Tool Work?

### Features

- **Input Quadratic Equation Parameters**: Users can input values for `a`, `b`, and `c` in the quadratic equation `f(x) = axÂ² + bx + c` as well as define the range of `x` values for the graph.
- **Dynamic Graphing**: The graph updates dynamically every time new parameters are entered and submitted.
- **Interactive Axes**: The X and Y axes are clearly displayed with labeled tick marks, including values formatted to two decimal places for precision.
- **Responsive Design**: The tool is styled using Bootstrap, ensuring that it works seamlessly across various screen sizes.
- **Real-Time Equation Display**: The tool displays the current quadratic equation based on user input for better clarity.

### How It Works

1. **User Input**: 
   - Users enter the coefficients `a`, `b`, and `c` for the quadratic function.
   - Define the range for `x` (minimum and maximum values).

2. **Drawing the Graph**:
   - The tool calculates the corresponding `y` values using the quadratic formula.
   - The graph is drawn on an HTML5 `<canvas>` element, with proper scaling applied to fit the chosen range.

3. **Axes and Labels**:
   - The X and Y axes are dynamically drawn, and tick marks are labeled with precise values formatted to two decimal places.
   - Axis labels help identify the orientation of the graph.

4. **Technology Stack**:
   - **JavaScript**: For calculations and rendering the graph dynamically.
   - **HTML5 Canvas API**: For graphical representation.
   - **Bootstrap**: To ensure a responsive design for various devices.
